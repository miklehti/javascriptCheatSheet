A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
Different Types of SQL JOINs
Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Return all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Return all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Return all records when there is a match in either left or right table
SQL INNER JOIN  SQL LEFT JOIN  SQL RIGHT JOIN  SQL FULL OUTER JOIN

Note: The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the columns.
If there are records in the "Orders" table that do not have matches in "Customers", these orders will not be shown!

Note: The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (Customers), even if there are no matches in the right table (Orders).
Note: The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (Employees), even if there are no matches in the left table (Orders).

Note: The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all the rows from the left table (Customers), and all the rows from the right table (Orders).
If there are rows in "Customers" that do not have matches in "Orders", or if there are rows in "Orders" that do not have matches in "Customers", those rows will be listed as well.
